The main goal of this research paper is to analyze carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide. In
particular, the aim of the paper is to observe how the population size of a certain country affects
the CO2 emissions. In order to explore the aforementioned relationship, a logarithmic panel
regression model has been implemented. The main findings are that both population and gross
domestic product (GDP) of the countries have significant positive effect on CO2 emissions.
Hence, those findings demonstrate that slowing population growth could provide high emissions
reductions. Furthermore, it was also found that the effect of percentage of urban population is
negative and significant, which is not in line with the findings of previous studies. Thus, this
research may serve as a ground for further research in exploration of discrepancies with already
existing literature and for further analysis of what factors influence CO2 emissions.
